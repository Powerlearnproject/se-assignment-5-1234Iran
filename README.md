  ASSIGNMENT 2 SUBMISSION
  Installation of VS Code:

1. Download VS Code: 
   - Visit the [official Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   - Click on the download button for Windows.
   - Once downloaded, run the installer.

2. Installation: 
   - Open the downloaded file to start the installation process.
   - Follow the prompts in the installer.
   - Choose the destination folder and any additional options during installation.

3. Prerequisites:
   - Ensure your Windows 11 system meets the [system requirements](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements).

First-time Setup:

After installing VS Code:

- Initial Configurations**:
  - Adjust settings for font size, theme, and keybindings.
  - Install essential extensions for your development needs.

User Interface Overview:

- Activity Bar: Provides quick access to different views like Explorer, Search, Source Control, and more.
- Side Bar: Contains different panels like Explorer (file manager), Git (version control), Extensions, etc.
- Editor Group: Where files are opened for editing.
- Status Bar: Displays information about the current file and project, including Git status and errors.

Command Palette:

- Access**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
- Examples: Execute tasks like opening a file (`File: Open File`), installing extensions (`Extensions: Install Extensions`), or searching for commands.

Extensions in VS Code:

- Role: Extend functionality of VS Code.
- Finding and InstallING: Accessible through the Extensions view in the Activity Bar. Search for extensions and click install.
- Examples: 
  - Essential for web dev: `ESLint` (code linting), `Live Server` (local server), `Prettier` (code formatting).

Integrated Terminal:

- Opening: Use `Ctrl+` ` (backtick) or go to `View -> Terminal`.
- Advantages: 
  - Avoids switching between editor and external terminal.
  - Easily run scripts and commands directly within VS Code.

File and Folder Management:

- Creating and Opening: 
  - Use the Explorer in the Side Bar to navigate and create files/folders.
  - Double-click to open files or right-click for more options.

- Navigation: 
  - Use breadcrumbs or the Explorer to switch between files and directories.
Settings and Preferences:

- Customization: 
  - Accessible via `File -> Preferences -> Settings` or `Ctrl+,` (comma).
  - Examples: Change theme (`workbench.colorTheme`), adjust font size (`editor.fontSize`), configure keybindings (`keybindings.json`).

Debugging in VS Code:

1. Setup:
   - Install necessary debug extensions if required.
   - Create a `launch.json` configuration file.

2. Starting Debugging:
   - Set breakpoints in your code.
   - Press `F5` to start debugging.
   - Use debug controls in the Debug view in the Activity Bar.

Initializing a Repository:

1. Open VS Code: Launch Visual Studio Code on your Windows 11 system.

2. Open a Folder: Either open an existing project folder or create a new one where you want to initialize the Git repository.

3. Initialize Git Repository:
   - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
   - Type and select `Git: Initialize Repository`.
   - Choose the folder you want to initialize as a Git repository.
   - VS Code will create a hidden `.git` folder in your selected directory, initializing it as a Git repository.

Making Commits:

1. Stage Changes:
   - Make changes to your files within VS Code.
   - Open the Source Control view by clicking on the Git icon in the Activity Bar (or use `Ctrl+Shift+G`).

2. Stage Changes:
   - Review the changes in the Source Control view.
   - Click the `+` icon next to each file to stage changes for commit.

3. Commit Changes:
   - Enter a commit message in the message box at the top of the Source Control view.
   - Click the checkmark icon (`√`) to commit your changes.
   - Alternatively, you can use the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and type `Git: Commit`.

Pushing Changes to GitHub:

1. Link GitHub Repository (if not done):
   - If you haven’t linked your local repository to a GitHub repository yet:
     - Go to GitHub and create a new repository (if it doesn't exist).
     - Copy the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repository.git`).

2. Add Remote Repository:
   - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
   - Type and select `Git: Add Remote`.
   - Paste the GitHub repository URL you copied and give it a name (usually `origin`).

3. Push Commits:
   - After committing changes locally:
     - Go to the Source Control view.
     - Click on the three dots (`...`) to bring up more actions and choose `Push`.
     - Alternatively, use the Command Palette and type `Git: Push`.

4. Enter GitHub Credentials:
   - If prompted, enter your GitHub username and password, or use a personal access token if you have 2FA enabled.

5. Verify on GitHub:
   - Refresh your GitHub repository page to see the changes pushed from your local repository.

Additional Tips:

- Branching and Merging: Use VS Code's Source Control view or Command Palette to manage branches (`Git: Create Branch`, `Git: Checkout to...`, etc.) and merge changes (`Git: Merge...`).
  
- Pulling Changes: Use `Git: Pull` from the Command Palette to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository (GitHub) to your local repository.
